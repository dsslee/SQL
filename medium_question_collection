# Acceptance Rate By Date
What is the overall friend acceptance rate by date? Your output should have the rate of acceptances by the date the request was sent. Order by the earliest date to latest.
Assume that each friend request starts by a user sending (i.e., user_id_sender) a friend request to another user (i.e., user_id_receiver) that's logged in the table with action = 'sent'. If the request is accepted, the table logs action = 'accepted'. If the request is not accepted, no record of action = 'accepted' is logged.

```sql
-- Plan:
-- 1. LEFT: request sent table 
-- 2. RIGHT: accepted table
-- 3. Join 1. and 2. to understand where there was an acceptance at the same/different day
--  * condition: same id on sender, receiver, and filter right table on accepted
-- 4. Filter joined table for LEFT action as sent
-- 5. Compute acceptance rate based on 3.
-- 6. Order by DATE ASC

SELECT S.date
        ,(COUNT(A.user_id_receiver)/COUNT(S.user_id_sender)) AS acceptance_rate
-- SELECT * 
FROM fb_friend_requests AS S
LEFT JOIN fb_friend_requests AS A
ON S.user_id_sender = A.user_id_sender
AND S.user_id_receiver = A.user_id_receiver
AND A.action = 'accepted' -- join only accepted
WHERE S.action = 'sent' -- filter table by sent
GROUP BY S.date
ORDER BY S.date
```

# Highest Energy Consumption
Find the date with the highest total energy consumption from the Meta/Facebook data centers. Output the date along with the total energy consumption across all data centers.
```sql
-- Plan
-- 1. concat tables
-- 2. sum consumption by date
-- 3. Order by total energy consumption

SELECT T.date
        , SUM(T.consumption) AS total_consumption
        , RANK() over(ORDER BY SUM(T.consumption) desc) as rnk
FROM (-- UNION ALL CENTERS
SELECT *
    , CASE WHEN consumption > 0 THEN 'Europe' ELSE NULL END AS data_center_location
FROM fb_eu_energy 
UNION ALL
SELECT * 
    , CASE WHEN consumption > 0 THEN 'Asia' ELSE NULL END AS data_center_location
FROM fb_asia_energy 
UNION ALL
SELECT * 
    , CASE WHEN consumption > 0 THEN 'North America' ELSE NULL END AS data_center_location
FROM fb_na_energy 
    ) AS T
GROUP BY T.date
LIMIT 2
